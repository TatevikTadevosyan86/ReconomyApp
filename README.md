Employee Check-In System
This Employee Check-In System was developed during an internship to replace the previous check-in process, which relied on Google Forms. 
This web-based solution allows employees to check in and out seamlessly and provides administrators with tools to manage employee data and generate reports.

Features
For Employees:
Check-In/Out: Employees can use a straightforward interface to log their check-in and check-out times, making tracking their hours quick and efficient.
For Admins:
Manage Employee Records: Administrators can add, update, or remove employees from the system directly from an admin interface.
Generate Reports: Admins can generate detailed reports on employee attendance, providing insights into hours worked, check-in/out times, and more.
